Fields:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (e.g., host, guest)

### 🔹 Properties
Fields:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `price_per_night`
- `location`

### 🔹 Bookings
Fields:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `total_price`

### 🔹 Reviews
Fields:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `rating` (e.g., 1–5 stars)
- `comment`

### 🔹 Payments
Fields:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_method`
- `payment_status`

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- A **user** can have multiple **properties** (if they are a host).
- A **user** can make multiple **bookings** (if they are a guest).
- A **booking** is linked to one **property** and one **user**.
- A **property** can have many **reviews**, each written by a different user.
- A **payment** is associated with a specific **booking**.


## Feature Breakdown

Below is a breakdown of the core features of the Airbnb Clone Project, each designed to replicate essential functionality found in modern booking platforms.

### 🔐 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Differentiates between hosts and guests to provide appropriate access and functionality.

### 🏡 Property Management
Enables hosts to list new properties with details like title, description, price, and location. Hosts can also update or remove their listings as needed.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows guests to book available properties for specific dates. Ensures date availability, calculates total price, and stores booking records in the database.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Handles secure payment for bookings using supported payment methods. Tracks payment status and links transactions to bookings.

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings
Lets users leave feedback on properties after their stay. Helps maintain transparency and quality assurance across listings.

### 🔍 Search and Filtering
Enables users to browse and search for properties by location, price range, and availability. Improves the user experience by narrowing down suitable options.



## API Security

Security is a critical part of the Airbnb Clone Project to ensure that user data, property listings, bookings, and payments are handled safely. Below are the key API security measures we plan to implement:

### 🔐 Authentication
We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authenticating users. This ensures that only registered and logged-in users can access protected routes. Authentication is vital for verifying user identity and protecting personal and sensitive information.

### 🔓 Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to distinguish between guests and hosts. For example, only hosts will be allowed to create or manage properties. Authorization prevents unauthorized access to restricted resources and features.

### 📈 Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse and protect the server from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rate limiting will be used. This limits how many requests a user can make within a specific timeframe.

### 🔒 Data Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-site Scripting), and other input-based attacks. This measure ensures data integrity and application stability.

### 💳 Secure Payments
Payment processing will be handled using a secure third-party service (e.g., Stripe). Sensitive payment information will not be stored directly in our database, protecting user financial data.

### 🔑 Why API Security Matters

- **Protecting User Data:** Ensures personal and account information is not exposed or misused.
- **Securing Payments:** Prevents unauthorized transactions and ensures compliance with financial data regulations.
- **Maintaining Trust:** Strong security practices help build user confidence in the platform.
- **Preventing Abuse:** Throttling, validation, and role restrictions help block spamming, fake bookings, and privilege escalation.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. In this project, CI/CD ensures that new changes are automatically tested and safely deployed to production without manual intervention.

### 🔧 Importance of CI/CD
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated tests catch bugs early before deployment.
- **Faster Development**: Developers get quick feedback and can deploy features faster.
- **Reliable Deployment**: Reduces the risk of human error during deployment and ensures consistency across environments.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks like running tests and deploying code on push or pull requests.
- **Docker**: Provides a consistent environment for development and deployment.
- **Render / Vercel / Netlify / Heroku**: Used to deploy the frontend or backend automatically after successful builds.
